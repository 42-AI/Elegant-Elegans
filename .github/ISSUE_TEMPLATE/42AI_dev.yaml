        Acceptance Criteria (AC) provide a detailed scope of a user’s requirements.
        They help the team to understand the value of the story and set expectations as to when a team should consider something done.

        AC Goals
          - to clarify what the team should build before they start work
          - to ensure everyone has a common understanding of the problem/need of the customer
          - to help team members know when the story is complete
          - to help verify the story via automated tests

      description: |
        Definition of Done (DoD) is a list of requirements that a user story must adhere to for the team to call it complete.

        The difference between DoD and Acceptance Criteria is that the DoD is common for all the User Stories, where as the Acceptance Criteria is specific to a user story
